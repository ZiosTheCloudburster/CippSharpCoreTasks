# CippSharpCore-Tasks
Custom Utils with System.Threading.Tasks for Unity

### Content:
Contains the main code TasksUtils.cs, Listeners and an example

### How to Install:
- Option 1 (readonly) now it supports Unity Package Manager so you can download by copy/paste the git url in 'Package Manager Window + Install From Git'. As said this is a readonly solution so you cannot access all files this way.
- Option 2 (classic) download this repository as .zip; Extract the files; Drag 'n' drop the extracted folder in your unity project (where you prefer).
- Option 3 (alternative) add this as submodule / separate repo in your project by copy/paste the git url
